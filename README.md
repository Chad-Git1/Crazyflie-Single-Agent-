# Crazyflie-Single-Agent-
This Repository is the home the Honours Project for Chad Yassin, Pronoy Fuad, and Kevin Naveen.


Here are the steps we will be undertaking:

1 - Build a core simulation environment

    Mujoco :
    - https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_menagerie/tree/main/bitcraze_crazyflie_2
    - https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/models.html#drones

2 - Build a reinforcement learning environment

3 - Train the flight control algorithms
 
    - On Policy : PPO
    - Off Policy : SAC
    Training using Stable Baselines 3, OpenAI Gymnasium


    
4 - Collect statistics

5 - Domain Randomization

6 - Sim2Real Bridge Phase

7 - Test flight with Crazyflie drone in CBY basement lab
