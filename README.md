This Repository is the home the Honours Project for Chad Yassin, Pronoy Fuad, and Kevin Naveen.


Here are the steps we will be undertaking:

1 - Build a core simulation environment

2 - Build a reinforcement learning environment

3 - Train the flight control algorithms
    - On Policy : PPO
    - Off Policy : SAC
    
4 - Collect statistics

5 - Domain Randomization

6 - Sim2Real Bridge Phase

7 - Test flight with Crazyflie drone in CBY basement lab
